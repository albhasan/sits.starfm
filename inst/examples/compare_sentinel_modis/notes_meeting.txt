  NDMI is the best, however, it requires Spectral Mixture Model which requires 
  in turn non-time series sampling of shadows and non-photosyntetic vegetation).

- Compute EVI2. NOTE: EVI2 for Sentinel-2 needs the B05 which isn't available 
with 10-meter resolution.
- Forget about the classifier.
- Run TWDTW using degradation patterns.
- Think of doing something different.
- DONE: Write the thesis' introduction
- DONE: Write an email asking for more time for the thesis jurors.
- DONE: Write introduction and send to Pedro
- Thesis name: Strategies for deforestation mapping using medium resolution images
- Read Mondial's paper.

# NEXT EXPERIMENT

Test if Sentinel-2's time series allow us to see what we don't see in MODIS' 
classification because of spatial resolution. In other words, use Sentinel-2 to 
disagregate MODIS' classification of Amazonia.

Don't compare to Landsat; forget Landsat, use Sentinel-2.

One of the problems of the Landsat-8 classification presented at GeoINFO was
its innacuracy when compared to PRODES, in special for deforeatation. PRODES
focuses on "corte raso" (slash) and ignores burn scars and forest degradation.

For that reson, we decided to mix PRODES' deforestation with DETER's burn scars
and forest degradation to better approximate the classification results.

We can use 4 or 5 classes. For example:
- forest
- *secondary vegetation - only available after post-processing, not during classification!
- corte raso
- degradation
- quemada
- agriculture
- pastagem

For an initial test, use a simple classification method such as SVM including 
a couple of features made of vegetation indexes (the new ones identified by 
Michell).

# OLD NOTES REGARING REVIEWER-2 OF PAPER ON CLOUD MASKS

Write to the editor, we have do not agree with reviewer 2 and we would like the 
know the opinions of editors regarding our paper.

Olafson relies on having a reference map of better accuracy and resolution that 
the one being evaluated.

# SEGMENTATION.

Also, we could use segmentation to improve the classification. Check "Parameter 
selection for region‐growing image segmentation algorithms using spatial 
autocorrelation" by Spindola and Câmara.
