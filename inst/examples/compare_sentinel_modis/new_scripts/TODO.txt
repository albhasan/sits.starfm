DONE - Build mini-bricks using (minX, minY, maxX, maxY) = (-65.10175 -10.10455 -65.02418 -10.03270)
DONE - Create an envelope shapefile and send it to Michelle (directory minibrick in esensing's dropbox)
- Change the samples' names to samples_A (all bands), samples_B (indexes)
- Too few samples of deforestation

Samples
- A (all bands)
- B (indixes)
- C - Take samples on each label from joined samples A & B
