IMPROVE THE FIRST CLASSIFICATION.

DONE: Use version 4 of the validation samples.
DONE: Get time series of the new samples.
DONE: Recode Deforestation as Forest as it was at the beginning of the time period.
DONE: Filter out Water. 
DONE: *** Cross the samples: Use ALL BANDS for training INDECES and INDECES for training ALL BANDS ***
DONE: Run the classification using 4 labels:
- Forest
- Non-Forest
- Pasture
- Natural non-forest

Join the last 3 labels (Non-Forest, Pasture, Natural Non-Forest) into Non-Forest before postprocessing.
Change the postprocessing rules to:
1) Forest     + Pasture       = Deforestatuion
2) Forest     + Forest        = Forest
3) Forest     + Deforestation = Deforestation
4) Non-Forest + Pasture       = Pasture
5) Non-Forest + Forest        = Forest
6) Non-Forest + Deforestation = Non-Forest

Compute the confusion matrix.
